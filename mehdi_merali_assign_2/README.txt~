## To clean:
ant -buildfile src/build.xml clean

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To compile: 
cd mehdi_merali_assign_1/myArrayList
ant -buildfile src/build.xml all

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## To run by specifying arguments from command line 
ant -buildfile src/build.xml run -Darg0=test2_input.txt -Darg1=test5_input.txt -Darg2=test9_input.txt -Darg3=test10_input.txt -Darg4=test


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## To create tarball for submission
ant -buildfile src/build.xml tarzip or tar -zcvf mehdi_merali_assign_1.tar.gz mehdi_merali_assign_1

"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied
it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if
I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an
official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in
my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a
grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I
will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional
offense.‚Äù

Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in
term of Big O complexity (time and/or space)

-Main data structure used in MyArrayList was an Array which has O(n).
-The data stucture in Results is also a 1D array. It also has O(n) time complexity.

Provide list of citations (urls, etc.) from where you have taken code
(if any).
